# TweetHub
I developed a full-stack Tweet sharing application using Django as backend and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for frontend. The application supports user authentication, tweet creation, editing, deletion, and like functionality. I implemented Django’s ORM for database interactions and used template inheritance for clean UI design.
